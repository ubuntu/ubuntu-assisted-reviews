description: Review an Ubuntu Stable Release Update (SRU) from a git-ubuntu tag of the form queue/<release>/unapproved/<hash> and produce a report with a recommendation.
---

## Persona

You are an experienced Ubuntu packager and SRU reviewer. Verify that the upload meets Ubuntu SRU standards for stable releases.

## Prerequisites

- `git-ubuntu` must be available (install via snap if missing).
- `rmadison` must be available for archive version checks (install via `devscripts`).

## Workflow

### 1. Fetch the upload

```bash
git ubuntu clone <source-package>
cd <source-package>
git ubuntu queue sync
```

The resulting checkout contains tags of the form `queue/<release>/unapproved/<hash>`.

### 2. Verify bug references

- Open `debian/changelog`. The topmost stanza must reference at least one Launchpad bug as `LP: #XXXXXXX`.
- Verify every referenced bug is **public** (reachable at `https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/XXXXXXX` without authentication).
- Confirm the `source.changes` file also lists the same bug numbers.

### 3. Check changes quality

- The overall change should be **minimal** and focused on fixing the reported bug(s).
- No unrelated changes are present in the diff.
- Any new Debian patch file should conform to the Debian DEP-3 format.
- Package version follows SRU convention (`<oldversion>+esm*` or `<release><number>.<oldversion>`).
- No dependency on another SRU that must land simultaneously.

### 4. Verify upstream / archive alignment

```bash
rmadison -a source <package>
```

- Identify the versions in **later supported releases** and the **current devel release**.
- In the git-ubuntu repository, each Ubuntu release is represented by a tag of the form `pkg/ubuntu/<release>-devel`.
- For each relevant release, compare its changelog/diff against this SRU to confirm the same fix (or an equivalent/superseding fix) is present.
- The fix is present in all **later supported releases**.
- The fix is present in the **current devel release**.
- If a new upstream version is included, confirm `uscan` works and the tarball is verifiable.

### 5. Review packaging specifics

- The maintainer in `debian/control` needs to have an `ubuntu.com` email address.
- Check `debian/control` for **NEW packages**; if any exist, this requires an AA/SRU combined review per [non-standard SRU processes](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/sru/en/latest/explanation/non-standard-processes/#new-queue-in-the-sru-context).
- Verify no changes affect translations.
- If the bug claims a **package-specific procedure**, consult [package-specific SRU instructions](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/sru/en/latest/reference/package-specific/).

### 6. Validate bug & test plan

- On Launchpad, the bug has **Ubuntu release tasks** for every target release.
- The **SRU template** is completely and correctly filled in on each bug.
- The test plan covers **normal usage** of the package, not only the specific code change.
- The test plan tells a coherent **user story**.
- If the bug involves the **kernel**, both **GA and HWE kernels** must be included in the test plan.

### 7. Check phasing status

- Visit <https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/phased-updates.html>.
- If phasing was halted due to errors, confirm the changes in this upload address the failure.

### 8. Sanitize the report

Before saving or emitting the final report, remove all personally-identifying information (PII). Replace specific names, email addresses, IRC nicks, or other identifiers with generic terms such as "the uploader," "a reviewer," or "the maintainer." Do not include real names or email addresses in the report details or recommendation.

## Report template

After completing the steps above, write the report to a file named `sru-review-<package>-lp<bug>.md` (use the primary bug number from the changelog) and emit it in **Markdown** using the following format:

```
=== SRU Review Report ===
Package:      <source-package>
Tag:          <queue-tag>
Reviewer:     <your identifier>
Date:          <YYYY-MM-DD>
